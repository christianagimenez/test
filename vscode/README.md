#### How to Share a Snippet

## Notebooks

But wait, there's more!

Snippets are shared via Notebooks, where you can plan out and think through code design problems with your team.

Notebooks can then be used to dynamically guide developers as they code, tightening the loop and keeping alignment between design discussions and implementation efforts.

Let's get you adding your own code snippets to a new Notebook!

1.  Select a snippet of code.

2.  Press `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` to open the command palette and type `Add to Notebook`.  
    _Tip &mdash; press `Alt`+`P` (`Option`+`P` on macOS) as a shortcut for step 2._

3.  Follow the prompts to add your code snippet to a Notebook.

#### Opening Notebooks

1. Press `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` to open the command palette and enter `Open Notebook`.
